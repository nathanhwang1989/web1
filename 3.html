<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>
JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)[9], often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is
high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
and first-class functions.
</p>
<p>
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World
Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers
have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
</p>
<p>
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional,
and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces(APIs)
for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
and the Document Object Model (DOM).
